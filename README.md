# Song File System Project
### By: Linda L.
## Introduction
Hi! Thanks for stopping by.
Let's start with some quick facts. 
#### What will the application *do*?
- The application will allow you to upload and manage your own music files,
where you will have the freedom to organize them into playlists, 
and play/pause/skip the files whenever you want.

#### Who will *use* it?
- It is intended for anyone who likes listening to music files, 
has music files to upload, and likes their music files to be neatly organized
and easily accessed in a Java application.

#### Why is this project of *interest* to you?
- As someone who listens to hours of music on the daily, I thought to myself,
"Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have my own music file organizer that is *not* riddled 
with ads?" And so came the birth of this project.
