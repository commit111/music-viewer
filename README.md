# Music Playlist Project
### By: Linda L.

## Introduction
Hi! Thanks for stopping by.
Let's start with some quick facts.
#### What will the application *do*?

- The application will allow you to store information about your favorite songs
in a dedicated place, where you will have the freedom to organize them into 
playlists, and view details about a song whenever you want.

#### Who will *use* it?
- It is intended for anyone who listens to music often, likes to record information 
about their favorite songs, and enjoys viewing their songs displayed neatly as 
playlists in a Java application.

#### Why is this project of *interest* to you?
- As someone who listens to hours of music on the daily, I thought to myself,
  "Hey, wouldn't it be cool to have my own music playlist organizer that is *not* riddled
  with ads?" And so came the birth of this project.
